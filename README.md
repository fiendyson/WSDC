Get image.png provided in repo and place it on machine and replace the file location in script

# Change the path to the image you want to search for
image_path = "**_C:/YourFolderHere/image.png_**"


If the image isn't a match with your slow button due to dark mode or an update etc, snipping tool a new image and place it in the folder instead.
